# NostalgiaX

A 3D web experience built with React and Three.js that recreates Y2K-era technology. Users scroll through a timeline of floating objects from the late 90s and early 2000s - Game Boys, iMac G3s, PS2s, Tamagotchis, and iPods. Each object can be clicked to reveal an interactive interface that mimics the original device, complete with period-accurate boot sequences, UI elements, and sounds. 

## Features

- 3D timeline navigation with scroll/swipe controls
- Fully interactive device interfaces with working UI elements
- Authentic boot sequences (Mac OS 9, PS2 startup)
- Game Boy ROM cartridge system with CRT display effects
- Working Tamagotchi pet simulation with stats and mini-games (in progress)
- iPod click wheel navigation with playlist browsing (in progress)
- iMac G3 color picker with classic Mac applications
- Period-accurate sounds and UI responses
- Object-specific background colors and themes
